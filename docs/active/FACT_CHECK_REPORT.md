## ⚠️ **ISSUES FOUND - NEEDS CORRECTION**

### **1. Ketamine Meta Description - Too Promotional**
**Location:** `ketamine-therapy.html` line 10  
**Issue:** "Rapid relief when traditional antidepressants haven't worked"  
**Problem:** Makes a promise about speed of relief, which is not guaranteed  
**Fix Needed:** Soften to "may provide relief" or remove speed claim

### **2. "Highly Effective" Claims - Too Absolute**
**Location:** 
- `anxiety.html` line 290: "Highly effective with proper diagnosis and management"
- `depression.html` line 294: "Highly effective with proper diagnosis and management"

**Issue:** "Highly effective" is too absolute and could be seen as a guarantee  
**Problem:** While backed by citations, this language is too strong for medical marketing  
**Fix Needed:** Change to "can be effective" or "often effective with proper diagnosis and management"

### **3. "Excellent Prognosis" Claims - Too Absolute**
**Location:**
- `anxiety.html` line 291: "Excellent with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications"
- `depression.html` line 295: "Excellent with appropriate treatment and support"

**Issue:** "Excellent" is too absolute and promises outcomes  
**Problem:** Prognosis varies significantly by individual  
**Fix Needed:** Change to "often good" or "can be positive with appropriate treatment"
