**Changes Made:** Title tags and meta descriptions updated  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED - WAITING FOR GOOGLE TO CRAWL**

---

## ⏰ **TIMELINE BREAKDOWN**

### **1. Cloudflare Deployment** ✅ **IMMEDIATE (1-5 minutes)**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Changes are live on the website

**What Happened:**
- Changes committed to GitHub
- Cloudflare Pages automatically deployed
- New titles are live at: https://allenpsychiatry.net

**You can verify now:**

### **2. Google Search Console Indexing** ⏳ **24-72 HOURS (or faster with manual request)**

**When Google Will See the Changes:**
- **Automatic:** Google crawls your site regularly (usually every 1-3 days)
- **Manual Request:** You can request immediate re-indexing (see below)

**What Happens:**
1. Googlebot crawls your pages
2. Google sees the new title tags
3. Google updates its index
4. New titles appear in search results

**How to Speed This Up:**
1. Go to Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Use URL Inspection tool
3. Enter each page URL
4. Click "Request Indexing"
5. Wait 1-24 hours for Google to crawl

### **3. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Updates** ⏳ **24-48 HOURS (after Google re-indexes)**

**When New Titles Appear in GA4:**

**Important:** GA4 shows page titles from when pages are **actually visited**, not from when Google crawls them.

**Timeline:**
1. **Google re-indexes** (24-72 hours, or faster with manual request)
2. **New visitors arrive** (using new titles from search results)
3. **GA4 shows new titles** (within 24-48 hours of re-indexing)

**What You'll See in GA4:**
- **"All pages and screens" report** will show new titles
- **Page path** stays the same (e.g., `/adhd`)
- **Page title** changes to new title (e.g., "ADHD Testing & Treatment Provo Utah | Allen Psychiatry")

**Current Data:**
- Old titles will still appear for historical data
- New titles will appear for new page views after re-indexing

---

## 📊 **WHERE TO CHECK IN GA4**

### **Report You're Looking At:**
**"All pages and screens"** - Business Objectives collection

**What Changes:**
- **Page Title** column will show new titles
- **Page Path** stays the same (e.g., `/`, `/adhd`, `/depression`)

**When to Check:**
- **Today:** Still showing old titles (historical data)
- **24-48 hours:** Should start seeing new titles for new page views
- **1 week:** Most page views will show new titles
