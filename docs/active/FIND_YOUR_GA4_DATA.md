## 🚨 **WHY REPORTS MIGHT BE BLANK**

### **1. Wrong Property Selected** ⚠️ **MOST LIKELY**

**Check top-left of GA4:**
- Should show: **Allen Psychiatry**
- Should show: **G-LKYXFGGJSP**
- If it shows something else: **Click and select correct property**

---

### **2. Date Range Issue** ⚠️

**Real-time reports:**
- Only show last 30 minutes
- If no one visited in last 30 min, it's blank
- **This is normal!**

**Historical reports:**
- Check date range (Last 7 days, Last 30 days)
- Make sure it includes days when you had traffic

---

### **3. Filters Applied** ⚠️

**Check for filters:**
- Look for filter chips/badges in the report
- Remove all filters
- Check if data appears

---

### **4. View/Report Configuration** ⚠️

**Some reports need configuration:**
- Lead Acquisition report needs conversion events marked
- Custom reports need to be set up
- Try standard reports first (Acquisition, Engagement, Events)

---

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION**

### **Step 1: Verify Property**

1. **Look at top-left** of GA4 interface
2. **Verify:** "Allen Psychiatry" is selected
3. **Verify:** Measurement ID shows "G-LKYXFGGJSP"
4. **If wrong:** Click and select correct property

---

### **Step 2: Check Events (This Will Show Your Data)**

1. **Go to:** Reports → Engagement → Events
2. **Date Range:** Last 30 days
3. **Look for:** `schedule_appointment_click`, `phone_call_click`

**If you see events here:** ✅ **Your data is there!**

---

### **Step 3: Check Acquisition Report**

1. **Go to:** Reports → Life cycle → Acquisition → Overview
2. **Date Range:** Last 30 days
3. **You should see:** Traffic data, user counts, etc.

### **What I Did NOT Do:**

**GA4 data is stored on Google's servers and:**
- ✅ Cannot be deleted by code changes
